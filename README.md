## GOV.UK Jenkinslib

A library for setting up CI environments in GOV.UK.

The library will need to be loaded into a Jenkins instance before being able to use it. This
will depend on Jenkins [being configured to load it](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#global-shared-libraries).

To load the library, use the `library` function:

`library("govuk")`

To specify a different branch for testing:

`library("govuk@my-new-branch")`

## Setting up CI on GOV.UK

For most Ruby projects, the following `Jenkinsfile` is sufficient:

```groovy
#!/usr/bin/env groovy

library("govuk")

node {
  govuk.buildProject()
}
```

This will set up dependencies, run the tests and report back to GitHub.

For applications: the `master` branch of applications will be deployed to integration

For gems: if the version has changed, the latest version will be released to rubygems.org

## Exceptions


If you need to run tests using a command other than the default rake task
you can do this by specifying the `overrideTestTask` option:

```groovy
#!/usr/bin/env groovy

library("govuk")

node {
  govuk.buildProject(overrideTestTask: {
    stage("Run custom tests") {
      govuk.runRakeTask("super-special-tests")
    }
  })
}
```
